# Conference Management System

This repository contains the initial project skeleton for the Conference Management System. The project follows the guidelines outlined in `PROJECT_RULES.md`.

## Structure

- **backend/** – Node.js + Express backend
  - `src/` – source code
  - `tests/` – backend tests
- **frontend/** – React frontend (Vite)
  - `src/` – source code with typical folders (`components/`, `pages/`, etc.)

## Setup

Each part of the project has its own `package.json` file. Install dependencies separately for the frontend and backend:

```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

You can start development servers with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

from the respective `backend` or `frontend` directory.
